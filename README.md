# pbft-default
 A project to study about the pBFT algorithm with different network structures: basic, group, and layer.

Steps:
1) Run the batch files : client.bat and node.bat to generate the associated folder and keys, then close all the cmds.
2) Run the batch files again to see the outcome.

Important:
1) Make sure to edit the main.go at line 33 to change the .json file based on the number of nodes chose in Step 1 (the node batch file; node_(number of nodes).bat).
2) After saving the changes, the .exe file has to be rebuild with the command 'go build' (require to install Go package in your machine).
